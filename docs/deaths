Death system ideas

   Current proposal:
	The ephemeral sprites system that currently dipicts
vaporization will be thrown out and replaced with pure graphical
effects, and other forms of death will use effects too.  This allows
no need for the "shape class" idea, as the fx would run on the sprite
no matter what it's shape and size are.  
	The fx for fire and vaporization would involve basically
changing the palette of the victim to that of alpha/beta or fire, and
then fading them out of existance while they fly backwards, in the
case of vaporization, and make them 'disintegrate' (in the classic
pixel by pixel sense) in the case of fire.  We can experiment with
these if they don't look cool enough.
	In the case of the more generic forms of death (various forms
of physical damage, the pure effect can be a flashing and dissapearing
in their hit frames, but I was thinking something a little more nifty
than that.  Perhaps they could fall backward and rotate before
dissapearing?
